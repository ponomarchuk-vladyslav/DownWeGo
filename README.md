## <div align='center'>Context</div>
This project was done for my programming 3 class, during my 2nd semester, in cooperation with another student. At that point I had a lot more knowledge, including lists, classes, WPF for display and a remake of the "engine" of my programming 1 project, on which this one is based. Unfortunately, this project had it's own share of problems, mainly because it was a team project. Me and my teammate split the project in two, with me doing the "backend" (game logic, saving, etc.) and them doing the "frontend" (screens, screen design, etc.). However, there were some issues with connecting the front and back end, so I took over a part of the front end, bringing the project to completion. Although in hindsight WPF might not have been the best choice for a game.

## <div align='center'>Description</div>
This project is a simple game inspired by [Pixel Dungeon](https://watabou.itch.io/pixel-dungeon), both for the style and gameplay. Instead, because of the requirement for the number of screens, we made the combat a separate screen, along with an inventory system. The ranged combat was also not included, due to the limitations of our approach. The enemies are also not moving, because pathfinding wasn't in the scope of this project.
